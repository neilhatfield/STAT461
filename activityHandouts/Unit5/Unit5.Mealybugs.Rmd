# The Context

Modern zoos try to reproduce natural habitats in their exhibits as much as possible. They therefore use appropriate plants, but these plants can be infested with inappropriate insects. Zoos need to take great care with pesticides, because the variety of species in a zoo makes it more likely that sensitive species is present.

Cycads (plants that look vaguely like palms) can be infested with mealybug and the zoo wishes to test three treatments: water (a null treatment/placebo), horticultural oil (a standard no-mammalian-toxicity pesticide), and fungal spores in water (*Beauveria bassiana*, a fungus that grows exclusively on insects). Five infested cycads are removed to a testing area. Three branches are randomly chosen on each cycad and two 3cm by 3cm patches are marked on each branch; the number of mealybugs in these patches is noted. The three branches on each cycad are randomly assigned to the three treatments. After three days, the patches are counted again, and the response is the change in the number of mealybugs (before -- after).

## What are the Statistical Research Questions?

[Develop at least two SRQs for this study]

# Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r loadData}
# Data
mealybugs <- data.frame(
  change = c(
    -9, 18, 3, 9, 5,
    -6, 5, 9, 0, 13,
    -4, 29, 4, -2, 11,
    7, 10, -1, 6, -1,
    4, 29, 14, 14, 7,
    11, 36, 16, 18, 15
  ),
  plant = as.factor(
    rep(1:5, times = 6)
  ),
  treatment = as.factor(
    rep(
      x = c("Water", "Spores", "Oil"),
      each = 10
    )
  )

# You'll have several code blocks here as you engage in EDA.
# You should create several data visualizations as well as

[Explain how our study does or does not meet the base requirements of One-way ANOVA.]

## Hypotheses

[State your hypotheses here.]

## Method

To decide between the hypotheses and answer our research question, we will use [insert method choice here]. To account for multiple comparison problems, we will conceptualize the following testing family(-ies):

+ [describe testing family]

Further, we will control the [name] Type I Error Rate, with an overall Type I risk of [value]. We will achieve this by using the [name] method.

```{r inference1}
# Apply your chosen method for the sampling distribution here

```

## Assumptions

[List and discuss the assumptions of your selected method to get to a sampling distribution]

```{r assumptions1}
# Assess each of your assumptions and discuss your assessment

```

# Results

```{r results1}
# copy this block (and update the name) as needed to complete your analyses.

```

[Write Up your results]

# Discussion

[Discuss the implications of the results section in the context of the study. What will you tell the client?]
