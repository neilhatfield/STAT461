The purpose of this guide is to introduce and discuss the five kinds of Type I Error rates. 

## Type I Errors

Recall that a Type I error occurs whenever we claim a statistical discovery that turns out false. That is to say, we reject a null hypothesis that turns out to be the better model. We might also think about a Type I error as a false positive test result.

While we often talk about Type I errors at the level of a single hypothesis test, we need to keep in mind that *each* hypothesis test we do carries a non-zero risk of making a Type I error. Thus, as we conduct more and more hypothesis tests, our overall risk of making at least one Type I error will increase.

```{r errorPlot1}
#| label: errorPlot1
#| fig-cap: "Overall Risk of at Least One Type I Error by Number of Acts"

# Creating the overall plot ----
library(ggplot2)
overallRisk <- function(acts, risk) {
  return(1 - (1 - risk)^acts)
}
overallRisk <- Vectorize(overallRisk)
ggplot() +
  stat_function(
    fun = overallRisk,
    args = list(risk = 0.05),
    xlim = c(1, 100),
    geom = "point"
  ) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    x = "Number of Inference Acts",
    y = "Prob. of 1+ Type I Error",
    caption = "Per Act Type I Risk of 0.05"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0,1),
    expand = expansion(mult = 0, add = 0.01)
  ) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 12)
  )

```
